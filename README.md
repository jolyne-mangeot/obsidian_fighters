# Pokémon fan-game
Group project done as a Pygame learning course with OOP paradigm and MVC code architecture. Based on existing combat-focused Pokémon fangames, this work tries to offer dynamic visuals with basic yet expansable features such as fighting areas, mechanics as game-accurate as possible along with our personal take on how to make Pokémon combat more accessible.
