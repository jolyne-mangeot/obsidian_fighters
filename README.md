# Pokémon fan-game
Group project done as a Pygame learning course with OOP paradigm and MVC code architecture. Based on existing combat-focused Pokémon fangames, this work tries to offer dynamic visuals with basic yet expansable features such as fighting areas, mechanics as game-accurate as possible along with our personal take on how to make Pokémon combat more accessible.

**Everything presented is open-source and done in an educational manner. All sprites, musics and sounds do not belong to us nor our organization and we do not declare any of our own property, instead crediting them to their rightful owners.**

## How to play

Download the game in a zip file [here](https://github.com/jolyne-mangeot/obsidian_fighters/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it where you want you download. Keep the game.exe with the game folder for the game to run properly, and you're set !

#### Start fight

Enter into combat with another pokemon. trainer vs trainer fights are yet to be implemented so you will only fight wild pokemon.

#### Check foes and manage your team
Check encountered foes. This will show all enemies that you've fought regardless of whether or not you've caught a copy of them.

Tapping enter on a potential will make them more likely to appear in the future. But before any fight, be sure to manage well your team for certified victory !

#### Save
Save the game. Simple as that. Will save your progress up until that point.

QUITTING WITHOUT SAVING THE GAME WILL ERASE ALL YOUR PROGRESS

### Combat basics
(there are currently 42 foes waiting for you to discover them)

In combat you will be greeted by your first ally and your enemy, and you will get a choice menu on the bottom right.

You win when the enemy is captured or their HP reaches zero.
You lose when all your teammates run out of HP

#### Team
Change your team in fight, and make sure to not send a weak pokemon to fight one that's much stronger than itself. Types matter !

#### Items
![alt text](./docs/Readme%20images/items%20menu.png "items menu in combat")
Allows you to choose between attempting to catch the current enemy or heal your active ally.

TIP: reduce the hp of the opponent to have an easier time catching it

#### Run
Attempt to escape combat. Has a chance to fail.

Failure will switch to the enemy's turn and success will send you back to the main menu.

### OPTIONS
